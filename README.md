### 👋 Hi, I’m Aisha (@Aisha-R-T)

🎯 I’m focused on transitioning into Machine Learning and Data Engineering roles, with an emphasis on clean system design and ML tooling.

🧰 I’m currently building out my engineering toolbox by working with Python, SQL, Git, Docker, and ML infrastructure concepts so that I can build better RAG systems.

🛠️ I’m especially interested in ML deployment workflows, MLOps, and designing intelligent systems that are easy to operate as a user and maintain as a developer.

### 🧭 What I value in a team:
I’m looking to join a team that values thoughtful, effective work over noise; somewhere I can grow my skillset and contribute meaningfully to the process.
