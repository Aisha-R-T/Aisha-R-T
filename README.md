### 👋 Hi, I’m Aisha (@Aisha-R-T)

🎯 I’m focused on transitioning into Machine Learning and Data Engineering roles, with an emphasis on clean system design and ML tooling.

🧰 I’m currently building out my engineering toolbox by working with Python, SQL, Git, Docker, and ML infrastructure concepts like data pipelines, embedding systems, and prompt orchestration.

🛠️ I’m especially interested in ML deployment workflows, MLOps, and designing intelligent systems that are easy to reason about and maintain.

📫 You can reach me at: tahirkheli.aisha@gmail.com

## I'm looking to join a team that values thoughtful, effective work over noise; somewhere I can grow my skillset and contribute meaningfully to the process.
